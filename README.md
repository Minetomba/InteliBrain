# IntentHandler Library

The file was a Python module designed to process user inputs and provide intelligent responses based on predefined intents stored in a `JSON` file. This project is flexible, supports case-insensitive matching, and is easy to integrate into chatbot applications or interactive systems.

## **Features**

1. **Case-Insensitive Matching**  
   - Handles user inputs regardless of their case (uppercase, lowercase, or mixed).
   - Ensures seamless interaction, making it user-friendly and robust.

2. **Dynamic Intent Handling**  
   - Loads intents from an external `intents.json` file, making the system extensible without modifying code.
   - Easily update or expand intents by editing the JSON file.

3. **Randomized Responses**  
   - Provides varied responses for each intent to simulate natural conversation.

4. **Intent Listing**  
   - Allows users or developers to view all available intent tags for debugging or exploration purposes.

5. **Error Handling**  
   - Includes meaningful error messages for missing or malformed `intents.json` files.

## **Usage**

- **Run the script.**
